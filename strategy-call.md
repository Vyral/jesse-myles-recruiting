<h1 class="join-us">Free Real Estate Business Planning Call</h1>
<h5 class="join-us-subtitle">Are you a hungry real estate agent looking for more?</h5>

<p>Dear Fellow Agent:</p>

<p>Need help finding direction and focus in order to sell more homes?</p>

<p>I’ll meet with you one-on-one to help you write a business plan that you can implement immediately to generate leads, appointments, and sales. </p>

<p>I know how challenging it is to sell real estate.</p>

<p>You have discount brokerages, competing agents, and hundreds of ways to get clients (all are not equal, I’ll tell you).</p>

<p>It can get overwhelming to stick to a consistent business plan that makes you money.</p>

<p><strong>My name is Jesse Myles and here at The Myles Group we’ve sold hundreds of homes.</strong> </p>

<p>I want to help you sell more homes as well.</p>

<p>I’ll learn about your needs, goals, and why you started selling real estate. I’m happy to offer my insight and advice on what your next steps should be.</p>

<p>I will also share with you what we’re doing on our team that allows us to consistently generate leads and sales. </p>

<p>Once I understand how you like to do business (referral, prospecting, marketing, events, etc), I’ll help you write a business plan tailored specifically for your skills and future goals.</p>

<p>You’ll walk away with a plan of action that includes steps you can take right away to find homeowners who will list their home with you. </p>

<p>This will help you get the commission, consistency, and the freedom we all want from our businesses.</p>

<p class="section-title">Here’s what a few agents say about working with me…</p>

<p><span class="quote">Jesse was one of the better presenters because he was a subject matter expert, he followed the course curriculum, and made sense of the material. He didn't stray from the topic and class was on time and well structured.</span><br>
<span class="author">- Jullian Barrientos</span></p>

<p><span class="quote">Working with The Myles Group has been the greatest adventure I have chosen to partake in. I am part of a team that truly enjoys helping each other because we know if we can help each other as a whole, we'll be better able to help our clients, and they are really what it is about. There are so many tools and resources made available to help us be successful. Accountability and constant learning are highly stressed. We're not just teammates, we are family. Anytime I or one of my kids has been sick, someone else from the team has stepped in to help my client without asking for anything in return. They've also checked in on me individually. There hasn't been a time that I couldn't call anyone from the team and get help.</span><br>

<p>You don’t need to pay a bunch of money to a real estate coach. You just need to have someone who you can trust to give you good advice about the real estate business. I'll help you for free. </p>

<p>Why am I offering this?</p>

<p>Maybe, over the long term – and only if it makes sense - you’d like to learn more about working on our <strong>team</strong>.</p>

Let me be clear that is not the intent of my offer. That’s another conversation for another time and only if you have any interest.</p>

<p>I figure there’s a good chance we’ll do business together someday even if you don’t join our team and I would like to get to know you. I enjoy seeing real estate agents succeed. It’s fulfilling, and I love it.</p>

<p>So I invite you to request a free one-on-one business strategy meeting with me below. We can meet for coffee, or even if it’s more convenient, a phone call or a video conference works, too.</p>

<p>I have a questionnaire I would like you to fill out so that when we meet so I’m prepared to offer you specific advice. When you request a call, I’ll email it to you to complete before the meeting.</p>

<p>Look forward to meeting with you. Let’s grow your business.</p>


<p>Sincerely,</p>
