What do sellers really want in a listing appointment? It’s a question every agent should be asking, because expectations have shifted, and the old script isn’t cutting it anymore. Hint: It’s not the same old script from 2019.

Sellers aren’t just looking for an agent. They want a strategist, a market expert, and someone who makes them feel confident, informed, and genuinely impressed from the moment you walk through the door. With lower inventory and more agents chasing after the same listings, a mediocre pitch doesn’t just lose you a deal; it can tank your credibility and your pipeline, and lose thousands in commission and future business.

To help you create a pre-listing presentation that works in 2025, I put together a list detailing the six things that sellers want to see:

**1\. Clear, data-backed pricing.** Sellers aren’t just looking for a ballpark number anymore. They want to understand how pricing decisions are made and where their home fits in real-time market data. Agents who show up with AI tools, easy-to-read visuals, and current trends are in a much better spot to lead that conversation. And if you can pull up buyer activity, comps, and pricing movements on the spot, it becomes easier to explain the “why” behind the number.

**2\. AI and tech-driven services.** Don’t show up with outdated tools. Top agents are using AI pricing models, digital staging previews, interactive tablet presentations, and net sheets that update in real time. And it doesn’t stop at the appointment. Following up with recap emails, automated texts, retargeting ads, and drip campaigns keeps you top of mind long after the meeting. This will also help you feel more confident at every step, from the first conversation to the signed agreement.

**3\. Modern, multi-channel marketing.** A printed marketing checklist won’t work in this market, no matter how well it worked in the past. Today’s sellers want to know exactly how their home will be marketed and how that stands out from everyone else. I recommend using digital listing books, short-form social videos, targeted Facebook and Instagram ads, and cinematic video tours. Drones, 3D walkthroughs, and influencer-style content are especially common on high-priced listings.

**4\. Pre-listing prep.** First impressions actually start before the appointment. Send digital pre-listing packets that lay out your strategy, include testimonials, and ask helpful questions ahead of time. You can even send short personalized videos to introduce yourself and set expectations. Doing so builds trust early and positions you as a polished and strategic local expert.

**5\. Social proof.** You’re not the only one who came prepared—sellers do their own research on agents *before* they set an appointment. They check Google, scroll Instagram, and review past listings before even making contact. Bringing social proof into your presentations, like screenshots of 5-star reviews, before-and-after photos, and client success stories, can build instant credibility.

**6\. Personalized listing consultations.** Sellers today aren’t interested in a one-size-fits-all pitch. They’ve done their research and can tell when someone’s just reading off a slide deck. They want *real* advice, not a sales pitch. You need to adjust your advice based on what matters most to the seller and learn to adapt to their communication style to fit each client’s personality. It’s less like a presentation and more like a real conversation. Remember: Sellers want someone who gets them and can create a smart, personalized strategy.

If you want to win more listings, then you need to be prepared to show them what a modern listing presentation actually looks like. Arm yourself with the data, marketing tools, and training that you need to move confidently. Most importantly, you need a reliable team that will provide ample support, access to tools, and training. I can help you with that. If you’re interested, let’s connect. Call or email me, and I’ll help you build a strategy that focuses on the things that matter.
