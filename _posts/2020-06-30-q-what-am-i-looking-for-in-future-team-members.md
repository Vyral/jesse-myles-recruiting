*Our team is growing, and we want members who have these three things.*

When I’m looking to hire another team member to join me, I’m looking for three characteristics above all. **I want to hire people who are hungry, humble, and smart.** Those make the perfect team.

**If someone is humble, they don’t think less of themselves—they think of themselves less.** A humble team member is focused on helping others and not their personal success. They’re there to help the team rise together as a whole.

**Someone who is hungry is aggressively pursuing their goals and dreams**. A hungry teammate is going to push until the job is done and that’s a great attribute to have in real estate. They’re also willing to do whatever it takes to make their mark and accomplish their goals.

Finally, being smart isn’t necessarily being booksmart. **It’s about being emotionally smart.** Team members who are smart know how to interact with their team and build them up to have greater success in the future.

If you consider yourself hungry, humble, and smart and you’re interested in what a career in real estate might look like, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon
