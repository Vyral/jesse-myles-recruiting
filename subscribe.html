<p>Dear Real Estate Agent:</p>

<p>Are you looking for training that teaches you exactly what you need to do to sell homes, specifically right here in Central Texas?</p>

<p>I invite you to subscribe to our free real estate agent training newsletter.</p>

<p>Every two weeks, we’ll publish helpful tips for you, which include:
 <ol class="indent">
<li>Real agent success stories</li>
<li>Question and answer videos</li>
<li>Highlights of our team training</li>
<li>Our favorite technology tips</li>
</ol></p>

<p>Our goal is to give you a taste of the training we provide in case you have any interest in working with us in the future.</p>

<p>We have no intention of recruiting you - that’s a conversation for when you are ready, if at all.</p>

<p>Last year, over 7,000 homes sold in the greater Central Texas market.</p>

<p>That’s plenty of business to go around for all of us.</p>

<p>We’ve been fortunate enough to sell over 100 homes in the last year and our average agent earns about $48,000 per year with us.</p>

<p>You’ll be receiving the same training they did so you can do it as well.</p>

<p>If you’re interested in knowing what we’re up to here and you’d like to stay current on the latest strategies to:
 <ol class="indent">
<li>Generate qualified seller leads</li>
<li>Attract buyers who actually want to buy</li>
<li>Convert more leads to appointments</li>
<li>Win more listing presentations at full commission</li>
<li>Systematize your administrative processes</li>
<li>Earn more referrals and reviews for repeat business</li>
</ol></p>



<p>…I invite you to subscribe to our free newsletter below.</p>

<p><strong>Here’s what a few agents say about our free training:</strong></p>

<p class="testimonial-text indent">"If you are looking for a catalyst to launch your career, then this is a great place to start. This is where proven models, cutting edge technology, and high quality tools and resources are your launch pad. You will be supported by an experienced, knowledgeable team who are dedicated to your success. They are always available to answer questions without limits." <span class="testimonial-author">- Vlad McDowell</span></p>

<p class="testimonial-text indent">"Working with the Myles Group has been the greatest adventure I have chosen to partake in. I am part of a team that truly enjoys helping each other because we know if we can help each other as a whole, we'll be better able to help our clients individually, and they are really what it is about. There are so many tools and resources made available to help us be successful. Accountability and constant learning are highly stressed. We're not just teammates, we are family. Any time I or one of my kids has been sick, someone else from the team has stepped in to help my client without asking for anything in return. They've also checked in on me individually. There hasn't been a time that I couldn't call anyone from the team and get help." <span class="testimonial-author">- Zulma Pena</span></p>

<p>You are also welcome to subscribe to our agent training podcast on iTunes and we will publish our free training content on our agent training Facebook page if you prefer to stay in touch that way.</p>

<p>Most importantly, everything you receive is designed to start a conversation. So, if you have any questions about selling real estate, you can email me at <a href="mailto:Jesse.myles@themylesgroup.net">Jesse.myles@themylesgroup.net</a>.</p>

<p>I’ll first answer your question by email, and if I think it would be of benefit to more people, I’ll answer it in a video.</p>

<p>We look forward to staying in touch. Let’s raise the standard of training for all real estate agents in Central Texas.</p>
